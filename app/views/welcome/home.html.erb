          <hr>
          <p class="text">The property was originally a summer camp. Bill Quinn had hopes of creating 7 cottages on the property until building codes stopped him. The cottage was built in 1950 and has had at least 3 renovations.  The Cape is a wonderful place to visit all year around notably for the beach, seafood and art communities.  The house is a great place for large family, friends and family reunions.  We hopeo you enjoy your stay.</p>
